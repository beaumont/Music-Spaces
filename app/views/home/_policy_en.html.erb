Billing occurs at the time of or shortly after your transaction.<br /><br />
You agree that you are responsible and will pay for all Monetary Contributions you make using the Service, and that Kroogi may charge your credit card, PayPal, Yandex Money or Web Money account in the amount of the Monetary Contribution and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your contribution.

MNC offered on Kroogi.com may change at any time, and Kroogi does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of MNC reduction or promotional offering.<br /><br />
If a digital download, or invitation, that requires an MNC becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to download, your sole remedy is a refund. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by Kroogi.
