  As you may know, the fundraising campaign for the Supertango@Vinyl project is proceeding under the Threshold pledge system (TPS). This means that a donation made by an interested donor is a prepayment that will be used to finance the production of the vinyl.<br />
  Usually, under the TPS, if the artist fails to gather the necessary funds by a preset date, all contributions are refunded to donors. But in our particular case, the Supertango vinyl will be released whether this campaign reaches its financial goal or not. The goodies you choose will be delivered to you upon vinyl's release.<br /><br />
  <b>Receiving Your Goodies</b><br />
  The official Supertango@Vinyl presentation will take place at the Music Town club in Moscow on December 3, 2010. Participants are welcome to attend the event and receive their goodies there.<br />
  If you cannot make it to the presentation, you will receive your item(s) by mail. We will contact you after December 3rd to request all the necessary information, such as your address. Once we receive your reply, goodies will be mailed to you.
