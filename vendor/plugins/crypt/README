# README

The Crypt library is a pure-ruby implementation of a number of popular
encryption algorithms. Block cyphers currently include Blowfish, GOST, IDEA,
and Rijndael (AES). Cypher Block Chaining (CBC) has been implemented. Twofish,
Serpent, and CAST256 are planned for release soon.

Crypt is written entirely in ruby so deployment is simple - no platform
concerns, no library dependencies, nothing to compile.

This work is placed in the public domain.
