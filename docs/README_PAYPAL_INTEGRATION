PayPal Integration with Kroogi 2008-10-29
@author  Kabari Hendrick <kabari@your-net-works.com>

We process payments using PayPal's Instant Payment Notification System (https://www.paypal.com/IntegrationCenter/ic_ipn.html). 
For consistency's sake, let's use the following as our outline:

Buyer/Donater:  JoeSixPack
Recipient/Vendor: Casual (donation basket: <http://casual.kroogi.com/>)

A visitor would initiate a transaction by clicking a form button on a Kroogi members' page. The form looks like this:

<form name="_xclick" action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" target="_blank" encoding="utf-8">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_donations" />
<input type="hidden" name="currency_code" value="USD" />
<input type="hidden" name="charset" value="utf-8">
<input type="hidden" name="cbt" value="Return to Kroogi" />
<input type="hidden" name="return" value="http://casual.kroogi.com/donate/thank_you/" /
><input type="hidden" name="notify_url" value="http://casual.kroogi.com/donate/instant_payment_notification/" />
<input type="hidden" name="rm" value="1" />
<input type="hidden" name="cancel_return" value="http://casual.kroogi.com/user" />
<input type="hidden" name="no_note" value="1" />
<input type="hidden" name="custom" value="MjBdW1BddoLoMxo8dNql%2BJPF%2BegOFhS3GQ4N7%2F1jAXxkXXWV%3B%3BMTldW77s8K%2BpXBNyLq9kkRauO8dNxZbE%2FfVy1cUADjv2coca" />
<input type="hidden" name="business" value="payment@threedozen.com" />
Donation Amount (USD) <input type="text" name="amount" value="" style="width:60px" class="payment_amount"/>&nbsp; <small>(Paypal)</small><p class="donation_message">There isn't a suggested donation amount, but please enter any amount you are comfortable with.</p>
<input type="hidden" name="item_name" value="Free Thyself from my Debt" />
<button name="submit" class="button" type="submit"><span>Make a Donation</span></button>
</form>

The variable reference can be found here: https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_html_Appx_websitestandard_htmlvariables#id085KN025030

The information is sent to PayPal where a transaction is made. After the transaction PayPal send a POST request to http://casual.kroogi.com/donate/instant_payment_notification/ (shown as notify_url in the form) containing information about the transaction. The information we receive is listed here by variable name and content: https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/e_howto_html_IPNandPDTVariables#BHIEFHHF

The most important information to Kroogi is in the custom fields we send with the initial transaction:
ID's of payment sender/receiver
ID and title of content (if any) being contributed to
Amount paid (gross)
Status of payment (if payment is pending/declined we would need that status)

These fields really just need to pass through the handler of the transaction and get sent back to us along with the rest of the payment information.

PayPal also sends us a special token that is unique to each transaction; I use this token to track updates of the transaction. Ie. A payment that takes a few days to clear will send Kroogi an updated POST each time the transaction status changes, we update our record accordingly. The special token is also used to reconcile payments: https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/howto_html_paymentdatatransfer

Reconciliation of payments, however, isn't a requirement if only a completed/instant transaction gets posted back to us.

Basically, all Kroogi requires is a POST request to a specified url with transaction details after a payment is made.
